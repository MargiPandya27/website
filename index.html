        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>I am a PhD student in computer science at UC Berkeley, where I am broadly interested in researching applied machine learning systems and human-centered artificial intelligence, especially as they pertain to socially impactful sectors such as education, healthcare, and sustainable development. My work is graciously funded by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
        With the global population projected to soar to 10 billion people by 2050, I have realized how imperative the advancement of smart connectivity in cities, agricultural systems, and healthcare will be in ensuring that unprecedented demand for food, water, energy, and healthcare is met sustainably. With a dream to develop technological solutions addressing such global challenges, I chose to study electrical and computer engineering as an undergraduate student. I am fascinated by the role that machine learning and artificial intelligence will play in these transformative advancements, and I look forward to exploring this potential through my work in graduate school.
        Learn more about my undergraduate academics, research, projects, and personal pursuits, and see my CV for further overview of my current work at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by Professor Niloufar Salehi.</p>
